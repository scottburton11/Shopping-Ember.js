Shopping - Ember.js
===================

This is an example app for the Client-Side MVC Shootout. It uses [Ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js) as a client-side library, and proxies Product requests to a separate API.

Getting Started
---------------
First, you'll need a product API with the appropriate fields. Use [gilt_api](https://github.com/scottburton11/gilt_api) to get started quickly. Be sure to read the README.

Set up your environment:

    bundle

Run the server

    rails s

That's it!


FAQ
===
*No migrations?*

You don't need a local database just now.
